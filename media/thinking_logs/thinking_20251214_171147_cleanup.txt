Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Adjusting the Scene**

I'm focusing on the backyard scene. My plan involves removing clutter, optimizing weather conditions for maximum brightness, and altering the camera angle to provide a comprehensive view suitable for pool design. Elements like the house, patio, and landscaping will remain unchanged. My goal is to produce a high-resolution image showcasing a clear backyard from an elevated perspective.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Instruction Adherence**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the user's instructions. The focus is to make sure every single instruction has been correctly accounted for. I'm checking specifically that all the elements are present, in the right perspective, and the yard and house have been handled. It all seems on track based on my checking.
