Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: compact pool approximately 12 by 24 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge
- an attached raised spa with water spilling over into the main pool

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Constructing the Scene**

I'm currently focused on the pool placement, size, and features. Right now, it's a 12x24ft rectangle with a tanning ledge and raised spa in mind. I'm aiming for a deep ocean blue finish with a spillover to make the overall look consistent with other structures. I've considered the shadows and sunlight to ensure the final image blends well. I will continue to focus on the realistic water caustics and reflections.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Pool Design**

My current focus is assessing the image against the provided pool specifications. The model's execution of the design elements is progressing. I'm focusing on the integration of the rectangular pool, raised spa, spillway, tanning ledge, and ocean blue pebble finish. I'm currently evaluating the placement, setbacks, and lighting to ensure full compliance.
