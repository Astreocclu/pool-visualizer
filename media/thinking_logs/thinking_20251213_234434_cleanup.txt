Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image ready for pool installation.
Maintain original resolution and perspective exactly.

[Part 1]
**Defining Permanent Features**

I'm working on isolating the permanent elements in the backyard image. My focus is on removing all temporary items to prepare the scene. The house, pergola, brick wall, furniture, plants, grass, and fence are all being preserved. I'm also planning to enhance the lighting for a bright, sunny atmosphere with sharp shadows and a clear blue sky.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Accuracy Against Input**

I've carefully assessed the output against the initial user instructions, focusing on the removal of temporary elements while maintaining permanent fixtures and the overall atmospheric conditions. The analysis confirms a strong alignment with all user-specified criteria, indicating a high degree of precision in the transformation.
