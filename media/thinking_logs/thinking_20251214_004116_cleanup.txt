Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Envisioning the Backyard**

I'm now focusing on the initial assessment, identifying fixed and removable elements. Next I'll adjust the viewpoint to get a clear view of the backyard layout. After that, I will work on removing the specified objects, and then I will enhance the weather to a sunny day with natural light and realistic shadows, while ensuring all permanent features are preserved.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm now comparing the generated image to the provided instructions. I am ensuring that all temporary elements have been removed while keeping permanent features intact. I'm checking the perspective and weather to confirm it aligns with the user's specific request for pool visualization.
