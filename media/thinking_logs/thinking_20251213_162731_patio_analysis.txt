Step: patio

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Keep perspective exactly.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Focusing on Installation**

I'm now zeroing in on installing the security screens. Specifically, I'm working to make sure the mesh is properly mounted to the existing structures and that the new vertical mullions look structurally sound and visually integrated. The aim is to create a realistic effect with the correct proportions and that the existing scene remains untouched by my modifications.




[Part 2]
**Verifying the Execution**

I'm checking that the generated image aligns with the user's detailed instructions. The implementation of the requested features, like the heavy-duty mesh and semi-transparent security screens, seems accurate. Also, the vertical mullions appear to be correctly spaced at five-foot intervals. I'm satisfied with the current state.
