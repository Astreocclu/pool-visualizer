Photorealistic inpainting. Install black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Enhancing the Scene**

I'm currently working on enhancing the image by integrating security screens onto the patio windows. The focus is on achieving a realistic look, including semi-transparent mesh, flush frames, and proper lighting and shadows. I've begun by applying the screens to the windows, aiming for a natural integration into the existing scene.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Request**

I'm currently cross-referencing the user's initial instructions with the generated image. My primary focus is on how the model tackled the core concepts, specifically the "security screens." I noted the single black mesh interpretation as a valid solution. I'm satisfied that it fulfilled all requested components as described.
