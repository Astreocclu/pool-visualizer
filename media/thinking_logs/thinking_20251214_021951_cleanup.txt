Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Planning the Backyard Scene**

I'm focusing on the backyard photo, aiming for a clean slate. I'm prioritizing keeping the permanent features, like the house and landscaping, intact while removing temporary items. The objective now is to set up a slightly elevated perspective for a clear view of the yard.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm currently validating the image against the user's instructions. I'm checking each element to ensure it aligns precisely with the given directives. The model followed all specified commands, and adjustments were accurately reflected in the output. I'm focusing on the requested perspective and environmental conditions to confirm their accuracy.
