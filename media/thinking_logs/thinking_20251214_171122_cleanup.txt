Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Refining the Composition**

I'm currently working on refining the composition. I've identified all temporary items that need removal. The permanent features are being maintained accurately. I have adjusted the perspective to an elevated downward angle, which should provide a good view of the grass area. Now, I'm focusing on enhancing the lighting to create a bright, sunny scene.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating User Requests**

I'm now comparing the generated image to the user's instructions. The execution was satisfactory overall, with temporary elements successfully omitted and permanent fixtures retained. The viewpoint is appropriate for the purpose, providing a clear perspective for the design. I will approve the result.
