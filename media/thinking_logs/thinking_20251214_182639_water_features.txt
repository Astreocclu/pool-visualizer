Step: water_features

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Add water features to the pool.

WATER FEATURES TO ADD:
- a natural stacked stone waterfall cascading into the pool
- decorative fire bowls on pedestals at the pool edge with flickering flames

REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH FEATURE:
- Realistic water flow with proper physics
- Natural splash and spray patterns where water meets pool
- Proper lighting interaction (reflections, caustics from moving water)
- Materials and colors matching existing pool finishes
- Seamless integration with pool edge, coping, and deck

POSITIONING:
- Place features in visually balanced, architecturally logical positions
- Waterfall: typically at the deep end or raised bond beam
- Bubblers/jets: typically on tanning ledge or shallow end
- Fire bowls: on deck corners or raised pedestals
- Scuppers: on raised wall section

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- Pool shape and water color exactly as rendered
- Deck material and color exactly as rendered
- All landscaping, structures, lighting

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image with water features installed.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Conceptualizing the Scene**

I'm currently focused on the overall composition. The stacked stone waterfall is envisioned in the image's left corner, with cascading water. I'm also preparing to integrate fire bowls on pedestals, strategically placed on either side of the pool. My next step will be to coordinate all the elements.




[Part 2]
**Validating Image Accuracy**

I'm currently validating the image against the user's explicit instructions.  I've assessed the integration of the waterfall and fire bowls; they appear seamlessly incorporated into the existing scene. The image adheres precisely to the provided specifications.
