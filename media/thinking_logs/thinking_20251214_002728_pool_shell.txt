Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.

[Part 1]
**Planning the Backyard Oasis**

I'm currently focused on defining the pool's dimensions and placement within the backyard scene. I've marked a 15x30 foot area and am considering appropriate setbacks. My next steps involve adding the rectangular form with rounded coping, followed by the tanning ledge and other essential features like the equipment pad. I'm aiming for a photorealistic rendering of the water, considering the deep blue pebble finish and light effects.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing the Pool's Placement**

I'm now cross-referencing the specifications with the image. The installation of the pool aligns with the defined location and required setbacks. The model incorporated the tanning ledge, loungers, coping, and lighting as specified. It meets the requirements.
