Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Revising the View**

I'm now zeroing in on the crucial elements for the pool designer. I've pinpointed permanent structures and landscaping to keep. Next I'll eliminate all the clutter, leaving a pristine backyard canvas. The plan is to create perfect weather and get a high-angle, unobstructed overview, vital for the pool's 3D design process.




[Part 2]
**Validating Image Accuracy**

I'm checking that the user's instructions were followed precisely. All aspects were handled competently: the weather is sunny, permanent features are present, temporary elements are absent. Most importantly, the viewpoint is elevated as instructed for pool visualization.
