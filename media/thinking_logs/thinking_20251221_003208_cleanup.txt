Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Establishing a Base**

I've established the weather and lighting conditions: a sunny day with a clear blue sky. Now, I'm focusing on preserving permanent elements like the house, patio, and fence. I'm removing any temporary items. Lastly, I'm adjusting the perspective to a slightly elevated angle. I will capture the entire backyard from the elevated angle for pool placement.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Prompt Compliance**

I'm checking that the generated image satisfies all user-defined constraints, including the weather conditions, lighting, and lack of transitory elements. My preliminary assessment suggests complete adherence to these requirements, preserving the requested scene as is. Therefore, I will now forward the image.
