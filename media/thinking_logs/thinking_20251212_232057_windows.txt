Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the windows. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

[Part 1]
**Analyzing Window Modifications**

I am now focusing on the window modifications. I've identified the three windows and the plan is to add the security screens. My primary concern now is achieving a realistic semi-transparent effect with natural lighting and shadows. The mesh texture and frames are taking shape. Shadow integration is the next hurdle.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Prompt Fulfillment**

I'm checking that the user's detailed specifications are met. The image's security screens, mesh, and flush mounting are accurate. The play of light and shadow on the frames and mesh aligns with the prompt.
