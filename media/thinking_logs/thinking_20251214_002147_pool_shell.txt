Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Maintain exact perspective of original image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.

[Part 1]
**Constructing the Scene**

I'm currently working on the pool's placement and dimensions. The initial excavation is complete, and I've positioned it with the specified setbacks from the house and fence. I've begun detailing the pool's interior with a pebble finish and water line, with clear blue water. My focus now is integrating the tanning ledge and loungers into the shallow end and accurately conveying the depth transition within the water.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Visual Accuracy**

I've just finished a comprehensive verification of the initial result against the design parameters. The requested pool features, like its specific shape, pebble texture, integrated tanning ledge, and overall placement, align completely. I've confirmed all requested features are implemented. This image reflects the original design specifications.
