Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Constructing a New Pool**

I'm now focused on the specifics of the new pool. I have the dimensions set at 15x30 feet, a rectangular shape, and am carefully considering its placement in the yard to meet set distances from the house and fences. The bull-nose coping and waterline tile are defined. Now the pebble interior with a deep ocean blue is being decided, along with the tanning ledge and loungers. Next is filling the pool and adding realistic light effects and shadows.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing the Model's Output**

I am verifying that the model fully incorporated the requested modifications. This time, all elements – from the shape and size of the pool to the tanning ledge – are as specified. Setbacks, lighting, and water features are also accounted for, and I am satisfied with the alignment to all provided specs. The image aligns with the client's explicit requirements.
