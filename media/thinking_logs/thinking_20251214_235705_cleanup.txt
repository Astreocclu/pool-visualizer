Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Revising the View**

I'm now focusing on altering the perspective of the backyard scene. The initial step involved identifying all elements, including the patio furniture, house, and fence. My current aim is to shift the viewpoint upward, giving a comprehensive view of the entire lawn, while maintaining the exact composition of the patio setup and existing structures. I will also make the sky a brilliant blue with sunny conditions.




[Part 2]
**Refining Backyard View**

I'm now comparing the generated backyard image with the initial user request. It's looking promising; the model did a good job of creating a wide-angle view as requested, making sure to show all the design elements, like the patio and the house. It's as though it incorporated every detail into one frame.
