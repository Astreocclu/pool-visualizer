Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Designing the Pool Addition**

I'm currently working on the pool design. I've pinpointed the ideal spot for a 15x30 ft rectangular pool within the backyard, carefully considering property line setbacks. I'm focusing on the pebble finish, waterline tile, and coping, aiming for a deep blue, realistic look. The tanning ledge and lounger chairs are also in progress. I'm giving special attention to how the pool water will look - its clarity, depth, and the way it reflects light. The shadows and equipment pad are next.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Image Accuracy**

I've carefully compared the image with the provided pool specifications. The rectangular shape, pebble finish, coping, and tanning ledge are all present and accurately rendered. The placement of all elements, including the loungers, is precise. The lighting and water effects are realistic. I'm satisfied with how it aligns with the instructions.
