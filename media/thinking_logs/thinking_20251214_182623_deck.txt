Step: deck

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Add a pool deck around the installed pool.

DECK SPECIFICATIONS:
- Material: natural travertine stone
- Color: cream-colored
- Coverage: 4-6 feet width surrounding the entire pool perimeter

DECK REQUIREMENTS:
- Natural material texture authentic to Travertine
- Realistic color variation within the Cream palette
- Subtle drainage slope away from house (barely visible)
- Clean expansion joints where appropriate for the material
- Non-slip texture appearance
- Smooth transition to existing hardscape where they meet

INTEGRATION:
- Deck connects logically to any existing patio or walkways
- Natural shadow patterns from surrounding objects on deck surface
- Appropriate weathering (subtle, not dirty or damaged)
- Match the perspective established in the scene

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- The pool exactly as rendered in previous step
- All landscaping beyond the deck footprint
- House, fence, and all structures
- Original lighting and atmosphere

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image with completed pool deck.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Designing the Deck Addition**

I'm currently working on adding a realistic travertine stone pool deck. I'm focusing on incorporating the user's specs for width, color, and texture. My focus now is on getting the color and texture right, with realistic weathering to match the original scene. Expansion joints and non-slip texture are also in the works. My priority is seamless integration with the existing patio, maintaining the overall atmosphere.




[Part 2]
**Validating Image Accuracy**

I'm checking that the pool deck matches the criteria: cream-colored travertine, 4-6 feet wide, and well-integrated. The texture, joints, and preservation of existing features are all under review, but the matching quality of the material and prompt requirements are the main focus of this step.
