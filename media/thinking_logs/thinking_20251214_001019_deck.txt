Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Maintain exact perspective of original image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.

[Part 1]
**Visualizing the Pool's Presence**

I'm currently focused on incorporating the pool into the backyard scene, paying close attention to spatial relationships and adherence to setback regulations. The design is solidifying, with a tanning ledge at the shallow end. I'm prioritizing the visual impact of the textured pebble interior, the deep blue water, and how these elements interact with light and shadow. The equipment pad's placement is also being finalized for integration.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Image Compliance**

I'm checking the image against the provided detailed specifications. The generated pool meets the requirements for shape, size, and finish. Tanning ledge and loungers are included and properly positioned, with precise coping and setbacks. Water realism appears strong, including light refractions. It looks like it fulfills all the initial criteria. I'll move on to the next step.
