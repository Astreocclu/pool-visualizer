Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Pool's Features**

I'm now focusing on the pool's core design. I've established the pool's dimensions and placement within the yard, noting the required setbacks. The next step involves detailing the pool shell, including the shallow tanning ledge, coping, tile, and the desired pebble finish for the interior. Subsequently, I'll move on to rendering the water itself, paying close attention to light effects and surface reflections, and adding the necessary pool equipment discreetly. Lastly, I'll integrate the new pool with the original scene, ensuring seamless shadow integration.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating the Specifications**

I'm comparing the design against the original pool specs. So far, the model has precisely matched the specified dimensions and layout, including setbacks. The pebble finish, water color, and tanning ledge are present as requested, and the integration looks realistic. Everything aligns exactly with the prompt's instructions.
