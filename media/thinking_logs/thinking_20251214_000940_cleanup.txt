Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image ready for pool installation.
Maintain original resolution and perspective exactly.

[Part 1]
**Maintaining a Clear View**

I'm focusing on the original image, preserving the bright sky and natural light. My primary task now is to remove temporary elements, like toys and tools, while leaving permanent fixtures untouched. I'm ensuring the house, pergola, and existing furniture remain in their original positions.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Fidelity**

My focus is solely on the model's accuracy. I've noted the image perfectly reflects the user's intent: zero temporary items, and precise replication of all permanent features. The outcome fully satisfies the prompt, warranting its immediate forwarding.
