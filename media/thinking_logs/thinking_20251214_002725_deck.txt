Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.

[Part 1]
**Adding a New Pool**

I'm currently focused on the pool design. The plan is to remove the existing pool and replace it with a larger, rectangular one. I'm paying close attention to placement relative to the house and fences, ensuring appropriate setbacks. I'll add a bull-nose coping and a tanning ledge with lounge chairs. The goal is to achieve a deep ocean blue pebble finish inside the pool and crystal clear water with realistic light effects. A subtle equipment pad is also being considered.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating Architectural Fidelity**

I've just finished checking the generated image against the initial pool design specifications. The rendering aligns precisely with every detail in the brief. From the shape and finish to the placement of features and the water, all is as expected. I'm satisfied that this iteration accurately reflects the requested architectural elements.
