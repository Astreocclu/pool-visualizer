[Part 1]
**Isolate the elements**

I'm focusing on isolating the brick and wood structure from the removable elements. I've pinpointed the furniture, plants, grill, and clutter for removal. My next steps involve digitally erasing these items and ensuring the patio and lawn appear completely bare. I'll maintain the existing sunny sky, enhancing it for a perfect, clear appearance. The house, roof, fan, and fence are staying.




[Part 2]
**Checking Instruction Adherence**

I've confirmed that the image aligns with the user's explicit instructions. The execution was straightforward, and the result is in accordance with all the specifications outlined. It seems this version is ready for the next stage.
