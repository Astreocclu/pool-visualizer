Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Constructing The Scene**

I'm currently focused on the pool's dimensions and placement within the backyard scene. Ensuring the 15x30 foot rectangular shape fits with the specified setbacks is key. I am working on the pebble finish and how it will interact with the water. The details of the tanning ledge and loungers are next, along with the coping and tile elements. Finally, getting the water's appearance, caustics, and reflections realistic, and integrating the equipment pad.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Image Accuracy**

I'm currently verifying the model's output against the user's specific requirements. The focus is on confirming that every detail, from pool dimensions and finish to the specified features like the tanning ledge and water effects, aligns precisely with the instructions.
