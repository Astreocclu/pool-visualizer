Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Adjusting Viewpoint**

I'm currently working on changing the image's perspective to get a better view. I will remove everything that doesn't need to be there, and focus on maximizing sunlight. I'm aiming for a high-angle shot, with an uncluttered scene, and sharp, well-lit details.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Accuracy Against Prompt**

I've been meticulously comparing the generated result against the initial user instructions.  The focus is on ensuring every specific detail, including the requested perspective and the handling of both permanent and temporary elements, has been accurately implemented. My process is very methodical.
