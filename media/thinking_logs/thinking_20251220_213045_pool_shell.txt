Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Planning the Backyard Update**

I'm currently working on the pool addition. My plan involves excavating and installing a 15x30 foot rectangular pool in the backyard. I'm focusing on realistic details, like the bull-nose coping and waterline tile. I'm aiming for crystal-clear water with light refraction and shadows on the pool's interior. I'll include a tanning ledge with lounge chairs and a subtle equipment pad. The goal is a seamless, photorealistic integration.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Pool Details**

I'm checking that the generated image aligns with the detailed pool specifications. The rectangular shape, deep blue pebble finish, caustics, and tanning ledge are all integrated. Setbacks, coping, structural and lighting details are all rendered with realism and correctly. The image fulfills every aspect of the request.
