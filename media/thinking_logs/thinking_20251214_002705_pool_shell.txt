Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.

[Part 1]
**Designing the Pool Concept**

I'm currently focused on the pool's architectural details. I've pinpointed the ideal open space for the pool and am working on its dimensions, aiming for a 15x30 ft rectangle, carefully placed to ensure sufficient distance from the house and fence. I'm prioritizing realistic features like a tanning ledge, water depth transitions, and a bullnose coping. Water realism is also a main focus, specifically crystal clear deep blue water and sunlight caustics.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Pool Realism**

I've examined the generated pool against the provided specifications. The rectangular, deep blue design with a tanning ledge and loungers aligns with all the key constraints outlined.  I've reviewed the size, setbacks, coping, waterline tile, and the realistic water effects. It appears I can move forward to the next step.
