Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Envisioning Pool Integration**

I'm now defining the pool's placement and characteristics. I've marked out the rectangular space, carefully considering its distance from the house and fence.  I'm focusing on the structural details: the coping, waterline tile, and the tanning ledge. The water will be a deep blue, exhibiting clarity, caustics, and reflections. Finally, I'll integrate the equipment discreetly and focus on realistic shadows and light.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing the Implementation**

I'm now cross-referencing the specifications with the visual output. The pool's dimensions and features are confirmed: coping, tiling, finish, and tanning ledge are accounted for. All aspects match the requirements, so I'll move on to the next stage.
