Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Establishing New Viewpoint**

I'm currently focused on the backyard image and shifting the camera angle to a higher, more comprehensive viewpoint. The goal is a clear, unobstructed shot that reveals the entire space. Removing the clutter is underway, and I'm preserving essential elements such as the patio furniture and pergola. The aim is to generate a sunny, spacious scene ready for planning.




[Part 2]
**Reviewing Image Compliance**

I'm currently focused on the image's adherence to all user requests. I've noted the removal of temporary aspects and the preservation of permanent features, maintaining the intended elevated and wider perspective. It's a comprehensive review to ensure full compliance with the user's detailed instructions.
