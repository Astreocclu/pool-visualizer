--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Refining the Setting**

I'm currently focused on removing all the furniture and clutter from the scene. This includes items like chairs, tables, and potted plants. After this is complete, I'll move on to cleaning up the patio and enhancing the lighting. The goal is to create a bright, sunny image with sharp shadows, showcasing a pristine pergola and brick house. I'm prioritizing balance and a centered perspective for a polished final result. I'm now working to make the lawn picture-perfect.




[Part 2]
**Verifying the Execution**

I've confirmed that the image aligns perfectly with the user's detailed request. The model appears to have accurately fulfilled every aspect of the prompt. Everything is as requested, and I'm ready to proceed.
