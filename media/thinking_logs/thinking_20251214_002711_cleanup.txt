Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Visioning a Pool Layout**

I'm now focusing on the image of the backyard. My plan is to remove clutter and shift the camera angle for an optimal pool design perspective. I've broken this down into steps: identifying key elements, choosing a new viewpoint, creating the ideal weather conditions, cleaning up the current scene, and then ensuring a blank canvas for the pool area. This should set a good foundation.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Scene Fidelity**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the initial user directives. The generated environment accurately reflects the requested conditions, notably maintaining the integrity of existing structures while incorporating the specified perspective. I'm focusing on ensuring complete adherence to the backyard specifications, especially the desired elevated wide-angle view for the pool. I'm checking for any deviations from the prompt.
