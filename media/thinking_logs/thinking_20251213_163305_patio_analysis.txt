Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Keep perspective exactly.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Adding Security Screens**

I am concentrating on integrating the security screen enclosure into the patio area. The plan is to ensure the mesh and mullions interact realistically with the existing light, casting shadows onto the patio. The original windows, landscaping, and balcony will remain unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Specification Adherence**

I've just assessed the black security screens' installation on the patio enclosure, confirming the flush mounting and realistic lighting. All the windows remained untouched, and the vertical mullions are present as directed. I now have the information I need to proceed with the requested text output.
