Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Maintain exact perspective of original image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.

[Part 1]
**Integrating the Pool Details**

I'm currently working on incorporating the pool into the existing backyard scene. My focus is on achieving a realistic integration, paying close attention to the pool's dimensions, finish (deep blue pebble), and the addition of the tanning ledge. I'm focusing on ensuring accurate lighting and shadows for a seamless blend with the existing elements.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Pool Completeness**

I've examined the generated pool image against the initial specifications. All requested features, like the pebble finish, waterline tile, coping, and tanning ledge with loungers, are present. I have validated all the requirements have been met.
