Step: deck

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Add a pool deck around the installed pool.

DECK SPECIFICATIONS:
- Material: wooden pool deck
- Color: warm terracotta
- Coverage: 4-6 feet width surrounding the entire pool perimeter

DECK REQUIREMENTS:
- Natural material texture authentic to Wood Deck
- Realistic color variation within the Terracotta palette
- Subtle drainage slope away from house (barely visible)
- Clean expansion joints where appropriate for the material
- Non-slip texture appearance
- Smooth transition to existing hardscape where they meet

INTEGRATION:
- Deck connects logically to any existing patio or walkways
- Natural shadow patterns from surrounding objects on deck surface
- Appropriate weathering (subtle, not dirty or damaged)
- Match the perspective established in the scene

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- The pool exactly as rendered in previous step
- All landscaping beyond the deck footprint
- House, fence, and all structures
- Original lighting and atmosphere

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image with completed pool deck.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Developing the Poolscape**

I'm focusing now on adding the wooden deck element. My current goal is to ensure the new decking has a natural wood look with subtle weathering and expansion joints, smoothly connecting it to the patio. Lighting and shadows are next, with a focus on realism. I need to make sure the original components are not altered.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm checking the generated image against the initial pool deck specifications. The model seems to have translated the instructions accurately. I am specifically focusing on the deck's color, texture, and width to ensure they align with the project's requirements. The integration with the patio is a key element that I'm currently scrutinizing.
