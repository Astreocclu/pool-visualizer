Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Adding Security Screens**

I am focused on integrating black security screens into the patio image. The plan is to precisely add vertical aluminum supports every five feet, resulting in clear, defined bays. I intend to ensure the new structures are properly flush-mounted and realistically lit, blending seamlessly with the existing architecture. My goal is to maintain the integrity of the original image, making the modifications appear realistic and practical.




[Part 2]
**Validating Specifications Meticulously**

I'm carefully checking the image against the user's requirements. The mesh installation, mullion placement, lighting, and window/door preservation are all being scrutinized against the specifications provided. Everything appears to be in order, confirming the image's adherence to the given directives.
