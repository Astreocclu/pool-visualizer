Step: water_features

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Add water features to the pool.

WATER FEATURES TO ADD:
- bubbler fountain jets creating vertical water streams from the tanning ledge
- laminar deck jets creating arcing streams of water into the pool

REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH FEATURE:
- Realistic water flow with proper physics
- Natural splash and spray patterns where water meets pool
- Proper lighting interaction (reflections, caustics from moving water)
- Materials and colors matching existing pool finishes
- Seamless integration with pool edge, coping, and deck

POSITIONING:
- Place features in visually balanced, architecturally logical positions
- Waterfall: typically at the deep end or raised bond beam
- Bubblers/jets: typically on tanning ledge or shallow end
- Fire bowls: on deck corners or raised pedestals
- Scuppers: on raised wall section

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- Pool shape and water color exactly as rendered
- Deck material and color exactly as rendered
- All landscaping, structures, lighting

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image with water features installed.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Defining Water Features**

I am now focused on defining the water features. The plan is to add bubbler jets to the tanning ledge, creating foamy water columns with realistic splash effects. In addition, I will incorporate laminar deck jets on the deck's edge, creating smooth, clear arcs of water. Sunlight reflections and caustics need to be added to ensure the new water elements seamlessly integrate with the existing scene.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Final Output**

I've completed my final check of the image against the initial specifications. All requested features, including the bubblers and deck jets, are present and correctly positioned. The overall aesthetic accurately reflects the input parameters. The image is now ready for review.
