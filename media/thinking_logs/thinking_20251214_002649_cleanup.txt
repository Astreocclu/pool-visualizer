Step: cleanup

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

PERSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENT:
Always create a perspective ideal for a designer to create a 3D render of a pool.
- Slightly elevated viewpoint (as if standing on a raised deck or second floor)
- Angle that shows the full yard footprint clearly
- Minimize extreme foreshortening
- Ensure ground plane is clearly visible for pool placement

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image with optimal perspective for pool visualization.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Adjusting Backyard Scene**

I'm focusing on the user's need for a pristine backyard visualization. I've broken down the request into key elements: a sunny scene, removing clutter, and adjusting the perspective. Currently, I'm concentrating on the lighting and weather, ensuring the sunlight is bright and shadows are realistic. Next, I plan to tackle the removal of temporary objects, keeping permanent features intact. The elevated perspective is being planned to offer a clear view for the pool's later placement.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Accuracy**

I'm now cross-referencing the image with the user's instructions. The execution seems sound, with the specified perspective and details present. All temporary elements appear removed as requested, while key permanent features remain. Weather conditions seem aligned, and the overall quality appears to meet the resolution requirements. Ready to provide to the user.
