Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Transforming the Scene**

I'm now zeroing in on integrating the new pool. I've noted the original image details, and the new pool's specs are defined. The plan is to place the rectangular pool centrally, maintaining required setbacks. I'm focusing on the water effects, considering light and shadow, and have concrete plans to subtly add equipment near the fence. The surrounding elements will remain untouched.




[Part 2]
**Refining Image Accuracy**

I'm now cross-referencing the image against the original prompt, focusing on specific details. I'm checking the pool's dimensions and features, including the tanning ledge and pebble finish. I'm also examining the water's appearance, looking at realism, and integration with the environment. I'll make a final assessment based on how well the output aligns with every aspect of the given criteria.
