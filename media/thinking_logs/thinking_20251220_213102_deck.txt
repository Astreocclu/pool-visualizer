Step: deck

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Add a pool deck around the installed pool.

DECK SPECIFICATIONS:
- Material: natural travertine stone
- Color: cream-colored
- Coverage: 4-6 feet width surrounding the entire pool perimeter

DECK REQUIREMENTS:
- Natural material texture authentic to Travertine
- Realistic color variation within the Cream palette
- Subtle drainage slope away from house (barely visible)
- Clean expansion joints where appropriate for the material
- Non-slip texture appearance
- Smooth transition to existing hardscape where they meet

INTEGRATION:
- Deck connects logically to any existing patio or walkways
- Natural shadow patterns from surrounding objects on deck surface
- Appropriate weathering (subtle, not dirty or damaged)
- Match the perspective established in the scene

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- The pool exactly as rendered in previous step
- All landscaping beyond the deck footprint
- House, fence, and all structures
- Original lighting and atmosphere

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image with completed pool deck.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

--- THINKING ---

[Part 1]
**Enhancing the backyard scene**

I'm now focusing on a travertine stone pool deck. I plan to add a wide cream-colored deck with natural variations to the image. I'll make sure it has the right slope for drainage, texture for safety, and seamless integration with the existing patio. I will carefully consider the lighting, and cast shadows onto the new stone surface.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Image Fidelity**

I'm checking that the generated image accurately reflects the user's detailed specifications. The goal is precise execution of all instructions. I'm carefully reviewing the deck's dimensions, texture, and integration with the existing structure. I'm making sure it aligns with the requested parameters and nuances of the brief.
