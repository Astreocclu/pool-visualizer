Step: deck

--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic inpainting. Add a pool deck around the installed pool.

DECK SPECIFICATIONS:
- Material: natural travertine stone
- Color: cream-colored
- Coverage: 4-6 feet width surrounding the entire pool perimeter

DECK REQUIREMENTS:
- Natural material texture authentic to Travertine
- Realistic color variation within the Cream palette
- Subtle drainage slope away from house (barely visible)
- Clean expansion joints where appropriate for the material
- Non-slip texture appearance
- Smooth transition to existing hardscape where they meet

INTEGRATION:
- Deck connects logically to any existing patio or walkways
- Natural shadow patterns from surrounding objects on deck surface
- Appropriate weathering (subtle, not dirty or damaged)
- Match the perspective established in the scene

PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- The pool exactly as rendered in previous step
- All landscaping beyond the deck footprint
- House, fence, and all structures
- Original lighting and atmosphere

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image with completed pool deck.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Expanding the Scene**

I am now focusing on the pool deck. I will add a wide, cream-colored travertine stone deck around the pool, aiming for a realistic look with variations in texture and color. I will also make sure the deck seamlessly connects to the existing patio. I intend to incorporate realistic details like expansion joints and a slight slope for drainage while preserving the rest of the elements in the scene.




[Part 2]
**Evaluating Execution Accuracy**

I've carefully assessed the output against the specific prompt requirements. Every element, from the material characteristics to the structural details, appears to align with the provided instructions. I am able to move on.
