Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Refining the Enclosure**

I'm now focusing on the black security mesh panels. I'm aiming for a heavy-duty look and feel. The placement and integration with the existing structure is the current priority, and I'm ensuring the light plays realistically on the new panels.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing Image Accuracy**

I've carefully assessed the image against the installation instructions. It meticulously reflects the required security screen specifications. The heavy-duty mesh, the flush mounting, and the mullion placement, accurately creating the three intended sections. The lighting is realistic, and no other windows have been modified. It's a precise representation of all criteria.
