[Part 1]
**Transforming the Scene**

I'm focusing on the environmental cleanup. The immediate goal is to establish a pristine outdoor setting. This involves stripping the scene of all temporary elements like clutter, and then ensuring existing architecture like walls and fences are spotless. The final step is to insert a sunny blue sky, contrasting with the current overcast conditions. The permanent structures themselves will be preserved, unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Confirming Accuracy and Fidelity**

I have carefully assessed the generated output against the initial user specifications. My current focus is validating the successful implementation of all instructions related to structure preservation, clutter removal, and weather modification. I am now preparing to share this result, as it aligns perfectly with the defined parameters.
