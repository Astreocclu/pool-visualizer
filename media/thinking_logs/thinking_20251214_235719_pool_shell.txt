Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: smooth white plaster finish creating light turquoise water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the light turquoise/aqua finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Pool Concept**

I'm currently working to establish the pool's visual details. The pool will be 15x30 ft, and I've decided to render it with light turquoise water to create a sense of realism. I'm focusing on the integration of the pool within the existing scene, particularly ensuring accurate shadows and placement, and adding a small equipment pad. The design emphasizes natural lighting, ensuring that any new elements meld naturally.




[Part 2]
**Validating Structural Placement**

I'm currently validating the structural placement of the pool elements based on detailed specifications. The generated pool model is now in place and the tanning ledge and lounge chairs are included. All requested features, including plaster, water color, and coping, are now incorporated. Structural placement and setbacks appear to be correct.
