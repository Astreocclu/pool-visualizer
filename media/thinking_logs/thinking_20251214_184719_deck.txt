DECK REQUIREMENTS:
- Natural material texture authentic to Wood Deck
- Realistic color variation within the Brown palette
- Subtle drainage slope away from house (barely visible)
- Clean expansion joints where appropriate for the material
- Non-slip texture appearance
- Smooth transition to existing hardscape where they meet

INTEGRATION:
- Deck connects logically to any existing patio or walkways
- Natural shadow patterns from surrounding objects on deck surface
- Appropriate weathering (subtle, not dirty or damaged)

[Part 1]
**Adding a Pool Deck**

I'm focusing on incorporating a wooden pool deck. The objective is to build a realistic wooden platform around the existing pool, using natural wood planks, texture, and shadows. The idea is for the new deck to blend seamlessly with the existing patio, while preserving all original elements. The pool, landscaping, and other components should remain unchanged.




[Part 2]
**Refining the integration**

I'm now carefully examining the integration of the wooden deck and the existing patio. I'm ensuring all specified characteristics, such as color and texture, are accurately rendered. The goal is a seamless and believable addition. I'm focusing on the technical aspects and working to finalize the adjustments.
