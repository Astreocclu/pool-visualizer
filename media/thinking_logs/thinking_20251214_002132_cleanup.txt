--- PROMPT ---
Photorealistic image editing. Prepare this backyard for pool visualization.

WEATHER AND LIGHTING:
Make the weather conditions ideal: sunny day with clear blue sky, good natural lighting, no clouds.

REMOVE ONLY THESE TEMPORARY ITEMS:
- Pool toys, floats, inflatables
- Garden hoses
- Yard tools and equipment
- Children's toys and play equipment
- Temporary furniture covers
- Trash cans and debris
- Construction materials
- Vehicles visible in yard

PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:
- House and all architectural features
- Fence and gates (all sides)
- Trees, shrubs, plants, landscaping
- Permanent outdoor furniture
- Patios, walkways, existing hardscape
- Lighting fixtures
- Ground elevation and terrain
- Property boundaries

OUTPUT: Clean, sunny backyard image ready for pool installation.
Maintain original resolution and perspective exactly.

[Part 1]
**Adjusting the Scene**

I'm focusing on refining the scene. I've successfully adjusted the lighting to create a clear, sunny day, and removed the temporary objects from the patio. Now, the layout is ready for further modifications. The permanent structures and furniture remain untouched.




[Part 2]
**Confirming the Changes**

The comparison with the user's request is complete. I've noted the removal of temporary items and the retention of permanent features, as specified. The model maintained the instructed sunny weather. It meets all the requirements, and I will approve it.
