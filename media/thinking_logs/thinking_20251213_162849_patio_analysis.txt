Step: patio

Photorealistic inpainting. Install Black security screens on the patio enclosure. Render the screen material as a heavy-duty Black mesh with Semi-transparent mesh. Maintain flush mounting frames. Ensure lighting and shadows interact naturally with the new mesh texture. Keep perspective exactly.

In your text response, state EXACTLY:
- OPENING WIDTH: [X] feet
- MULLION COUNT: [Y]
- POSITIONS: [list] IMPORTANT: Install visible vertical aluminum structural mullions (support posts) every 5 feet across the screen span - these mullions are essential and must be clearly visible. Focus EXCLUSIVELY on enclosing the open patio/porch areas. Leave all standard windows and other openings in their original state.

[Part 1]
**Modifying the Enclosure**

I'm now incorporating black security mesh and aluminum mullions into the patio enclosure. I've initiated this by preserving the original patio image. Next, I'll add the security mesh to the open areas and install black aluminum mullions at the precise 5-foot spacing intervals, creating a strong, secure structure. I will ensure the additions integrate naturally within the existing environment.




[Part 2]
**Analyzing the Execution**

I've meticulously assessed the rendered image against the user's detailed specifications. The image aligns precisely with every provided instruction. I am now preparing the final output for delivery.
