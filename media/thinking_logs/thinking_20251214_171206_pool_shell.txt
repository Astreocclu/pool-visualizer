Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: medium-sized pool approximately 15 by 30 feet
- Shape: rectangular pool
- Interior finish: textured pebble finish with deep ocean blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

BUILT-IN FEATURES:
Include these built-in features as part of the pool structure:
- a tanning ledge (Baja shelf) with 4-6 inches of water
- 2 ledge lounger chairs on the tanning ledge

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the deep ocean blue finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Planning the Oasis**

I am currently working on the backyard transformation. I have identified the ideal location for the pool and started designing its dimensions and features. The plan is for a rectangular pool with a rounded edge, shallow tanning ledge, and ocean blue finish. I am focused on detailed water effects, caustics, and realistic integration with the existing scene. The goal is to make it appear as if the pool has always been there. I'm taking special care with shadows and scale.




[Part 2]
**Verifying Requirements Compliance**

I'm now thoroughly examining the image against the installation specifications. The focus is on verifying each element: the pool's dimensions, the finish, and the specified features like the tanning ledge. All aspects are receiving a precise assessment against the initial criteria. I'm focusing on the overall scene integration.
