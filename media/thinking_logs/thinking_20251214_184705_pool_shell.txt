Photorealistic inpainting. Install a swimming pool in this backyard.

POOL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Size: compact pool approximately 12 by 24 feet
- Shape: oval-shaped pool
- Interior finish: dark pebble finish with deep midnight blue water

POOL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Position pool in the most logical open area of the yard
- Minimum 5 feet apparent setback from house
- Minimum 3 feet apparent setback from fence lines
- Pool coping (rounded bull-nose edge) around entire perimeter
- Waterline tile visible at the surface level
- Depth transition visible through water (shallow to deep end)
- Pool equipment pad area (subtle, near fence)

WATER APPEARANCE:
- Crystal clear water with realistic color from the dark navy/black finish
- Light refraction patterns (caustics) visible on pool floor
- Subtle surface reflections matching sky and surroundings
- Water level approximately 6 inches below coping
- Natural depth shadows on pool walls visible through water

CRITICAL INTEGRATION:
- Pool must look INSTALLED, not floating or pasted on
- Shadows cast correctly based on sun position in image
- Scale must be realistic relative to house and yard
- Match the perspective established in the cleaned image
- Preserve all structures, fence, trees outside pool footprint

OUTPUT: Photorealistic image showing installed pool shell.
Output at the highest resolution possible.

[Part 1]
**Developing the Pool's Presence**

I'm now focusing on integrating the pool seamlessly into the scene, considering the existing lighting and textures. I've defined the pool's dimensions and placement, ensuring it's appropriately distanced from the patio and fences. The pool's construction, including its shell and water details, is taking shape to produce a realistic appearance. Rendering the equipment pad now. I'm prioritizing realistic integration.




[Part 2]
**Assessing Compliance Now**

I'm currently reviewing the final image against the detailed pool specifications. I've noted the accurate implementation of the oval pool's dimensions and finishes, including the dark pebble texture, waterline tiles, and rounded coping. The water's deep blue color and the associated shadows appear realistic. All placement constraints seem to be satisfied.
