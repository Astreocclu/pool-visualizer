Wrap up the current session:

1. Run `git status` - if uncommitted changes exist, run the /save workflow first
2. Update TODO.md:
   - Check off completed items
   - Add any new items discovered
   - Move "Up Next" items if priorities changed
3. Update SESSION-NOTES.md:
   - Move current "Latest Session" to "Previous Sessions"
   - Fill in new "Latest Session" with today's date, branch, what we did, what's working, what's broken, and next steps
4. Show me the updated files
5. Tell me what the next logical task is for the next session
