Safely switch to a different feature branch:

1. Run `git status` - if uncommitted changes exist, run the /save workflow first
2. Show me current branch and available branches with `git branch`
3. Ask which branch I want to switch to
4. Run `git checkout [branch]`
5. Run `git pull` to get latest
6. Read any branch-specific notes in TODO.md or SESSION-NOTES.md
7. Tell me the current state of that feature
