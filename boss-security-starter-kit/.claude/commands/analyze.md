Analyze before acting:

1. Read the problem or request I just described
2. Identify what files/components are involved
3. Break down the task into 3-5 concrete subtasks
4. Identify any risks or dependencies
5. Present your analysis and proposed plan
6. STOP and wait for my feedback before making any changes

Do not write or modify any code until I approve the plan.
