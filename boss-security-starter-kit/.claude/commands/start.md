Start a new work session:

1. Read PLAN.md, TODO.md, and SESSION-NOTES.md
2. Run `git status` and `git branch` to check current state
3. Summarize where we left off based on SESSION-NOTES.md
4. Ask what I want to focus on today
5. Confirm the branch I should be on for that work

Do not make any changes until I confirm the focus.
